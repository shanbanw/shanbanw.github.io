## Asset Processing
Unity reads and processes any files that you add to the Assets folder, converting the contents of the file to internal game-ready data. The asset files themselves remain unchanged, and the internal data is stored in the projectâ€™s Library folder.
Unity stores the internal representation of your assets in the Library folder which is like a cache folder.
